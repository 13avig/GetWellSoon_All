          <h1 class = "banner-title">Did you know?</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">80% of clinical trials are delayed due to lack of patient participation.
            Conversely, most patients never hear about clinical trials that they could have participated in and benefited from.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-title">What we do</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">GetWellSoon helps people with medical conditions search for a potential cure by connecting
            them to relevant clinical trials close to their homes.
            We have aggregated more than 500,000 clinical trials by partnering with leading hospitals, government organizations,
            and medical sites.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-title">Founding story</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">GetWellSoon.ai was founded by two brothers, students with a big dream.
            One of them is a clinical trial patient himself. He has a terminal disorder called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,
            a rare condition that affects 1 in 5000 boys and hinders the growth of muscles.
            After searching for a clinical trial for 10+ years, he noticed two things: the information was mostly
            available in government protected databases; and there were so many scattered medical websites
            that were too hard to find and navigate.
            <br/><br/>
            So they decided to simplify how patients connected with clinical trials,
            and what started as a summer project became GetWellSoon.ai.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-title">Under the hood</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">The platform is divided up into three modules: the search engine,
            the extraction engine, and the connect engine.
            The search engine takes in patient information and matches the most relevant trials
            based on medical condition, age, and location. The extraction engine collects
            unstructured trial data from 100s of hospitals, government organizations,
            and medical websites, normalizes it and stores it as structured data.
            The connect engine allows researchers to promote their trials and
            enroll patients using our platform. We send personalized email alerts to patients.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-title">Product roadmap</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">We are building trial matching based on
            natural language processing and machine learning, so that we are able to
            understand patient intent, medical conditions and clinical trial intent much better.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-title">Our vision</h1>
          <p class = "banner-text">While we started with clinical trials,
            our vision is to build the Khan Academy for healthcare, i.e.
            make healthcare available to anyone anywhere. Be it someone searching
            for a clinical trial and enrolling, or someone trying to understand
            their symptoms to narrow down the medical condition and quickly connect with the right specialist.
          </p>
          <h1 class = "banner-footer">We want every patient to find a cure and get well soon!</h1>
